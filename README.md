Face Detection Using OpenCV
Project Description
This project implements a face detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascades. The system can accurately identify and locate faces in images or videos, making it suitable for various applications such as security systems, photo management, and real-time monitoring.

Features
Detects faces in real-time from webcam feed.
Supports image and video input for face detection.
High accuracy with low latency.
Easy to integrate with other systems.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git
Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git
cd face-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the project, use the following commands:

For image input:

bash
Copy code
